Contributing
Generally, a lot of talks are welcome on this list. The topic does not matter too much - it should be linked to Computer Science - but the format does. Talks are welcome if

they were recorded at a conference or meetup (i.e. no screencasts or vlogging)
they are awesome™!
I hope that is straightforward, understandable and makes sense.

When adding a new section/subsection or entry, please try to ensure it's sorted accordingly:

The two top-level sections (Languages and Theory) have their subsection headings organised alphabetically (APL > VimL).

The Languages subsections are sorted ascending by year (last field), then alphabetically by title. For example, an entry with (2012) should be below one with (2017) regardless of title; entries from the same year are then alphabetised within each year-group.

Groups of years are separated from one another by <br>\n (<br> followed by an empty line), except if a group would contain only a few (<= 3) talks and it is near another small group, in which case small adjacent year-groups are consolidated. An entry or two might also be included in an adjacent larger year-group iff the entries have different years.
The Theory subsections are sorted only ascendingly by year, with no attention to title, and no grouping by year.

It doesn't matter where in a group of same-year-talks a specific (added) talk goes
